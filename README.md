[Java Applet Path Tracer (click to go to demo page)](http://appletpt.llbit.se)

To run the path tracer from the command line:

    $ ant run

I consider this code to be so general that it should be public domain.
As far as I am concerned anyone can use this for anything they want,
but credits are appreciated if you do use my code =)
