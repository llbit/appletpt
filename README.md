Minimal Path Tracer in Java
===========================

Copyright (c) 2013-2016, Jesper Ã–qvist

To run the path tracer from the command line with [Gradle][1]:

    $ gradle run


Earlier versions of this code were in the public domain, but I changed
the license to The Modified BSD License to make it more useful for real
projects that need a battle tested license.


Requirements
------------

* Java 8
* [Gradle][1]


Change Log
----------

The first version of this code was created in 2013 as a Java Applet.

In 2016 I rewrote it to use JavaFX and remove the applet code because Java
applets are no longer a thing.
